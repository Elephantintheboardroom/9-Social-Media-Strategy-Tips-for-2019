1.    Audit this year’s Social Media Performance
There’s no other way to understand if your social media has been successful than completing an annual review. First and foremost, you should audit your social media content strategy at a granular level. Being able to understand what you have done well, how to build and enhance on it or to figure out what to do better next year is invaluable. This process can be draining – but just know it is vital. Revisit the content you’ve published throughout the year. Understand what has resonated and achieved the most engagement with your audience - and what didn’t. Pivot accordingly. 
2.    Define your Brands Social Media Marketing Goals for 2019
As with all planning… success is about setting and measuring goals. Know what is needed every step of the way! Decide what events and highlights you want to showcase to align with your brand and ensure goals are bold, but realistic, achievable and measurable. 
3.    Create Audience Personas & Profiles
“Thinking” that you know your followers, best customers or audience is simply not enough. You have to invest in surveying, interviewing, meeting and actually knowing your client’s needs. Get out of your comfort zone and understand and profile the people you are dealing with. Define your “ideal” high value audience and understand why they want to deal with your brand. Unlock this and understand the exposure you need to grow.  
4.    Identify the best Social Channels for your Brand and Learn the best times to post
Research suggests that posting between 12 noon and 3 pm on weekdays, is the best time to be actively posting on social media platforms. But don’t overdo it. Creating too much context, especially similar content can lead to your supporter clicking “unfollow” and saying good bye.

Understanding your competition helps you keep up, evolve or stay a step ahead with your products, services and brand. Whether you are inspired, encouraged or shocked, always be learning.
